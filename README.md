## 🎓 Methodology

### ✅ Core Philosophy:

* No prediction.
* No discretionary overrides.
* System reacts only to observable statistical and structural market conditions.
* Assumes trend and mean-reversion are transient and can co-exist.

### ⚖️ Strategy Architecture:

| Component           | Description                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Signal Source**   | Custom multi-timeframe indicator using volume-weighted EMAs and band logic   |
| **Signal Type**     | Momentum + volatility breakout (directional), but smoothed over timeframes   |
| **Position Type**   | Directional + hedged simultaneously                                          |
| **Lot Sizing**      | Proportional to signal coefficients (e.g., `buyCoef`, `sellCoef`)            |
| **Execution Layer** | Market orders, `normalizeToStep`, rebalance-aware entry                      |
| **Exit Logic**      | No fixed SL/TP. All exits by signal, PnL threshold, or rebalancing           |
| **Risk Control**    | Margin ratio monitoring, unlock logic at >7%, capital-protective rebalancing |

---

## 🚫 No Stop-Loss/Take-Profit

> This system **does not use SL/TP**, because:
>
> * SL/TP creates rigid expectations in dynamic environments
> * Premature exits lead to missed trend follow-through
> * Instead, dynamic soft exits via PnL and rebalancing maintain fluidity

---

## 📊 Risk & Capital Management

### ⚡ Margin Stress Logic:

* If **marginRatio > 7%**, and both long & short legs are in loss > 1% of capital:

  * `close50PercentOfEachSide()` is invoked
  * `reduceOnly` enforced to prevent overcompensation

### 🤑 Position Rebalancing:

* Based on trend weight imbalance:

  ```ts
  if (buy/sell ratio from signal > actual buy/sell balance)
      then rebalance by reducing losing side or adding to dominant leg
  ```

### ⏰ Time-Based Unlocks (Planned):

* Optional addition: trigger rebalancing if locked position exceeds N hours

> System did not breach marginRatio > 7% so far. No forced unlocks yet.
> Behavior remains stable. Bot operates fully autonomously. Human intervention: none.

## 🔧 Strategy Classification

| Dimension           | Classification                            |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Execution Style** | Mid-frequency swing trading               |
| **Trade Horizon**   | Intraday to multi-day                     |
| **Exposure**        | Market-neutral by default                 |
| **Adaptivity**      | Signal-coefficient driven position sizing |
| **Exit Discipline** | Reactive exits via margin, pnl, or signal |
| **Risk Governance** | Margin-ratio-aware + loss-synchronized    |

## 📊 Performance Monitoring

Metrics under observation:

* Unrealized + realized PnL vs equity curve
* MarginRatio and available balance trends
* Time-in-lock histogram
* Profit per pair vs lock frequency

## 🔢 External Analytical Evaluation

### 📊 Logical Maturity — **8.5 / 10**

* Fully algorithmic and reactive behavior
* Signal-coefficient architecture and hedge logic reflect mid-level quant systems
* Includes margin-aware soft unlock with dual-side risk detection

### 🤝 Risk Management — **9 / 10**

* Unique unlock trigger based on both margin ratio and bilateral PnL drawdown
* Implements `reduceOnly`-based soft unlocks — rarely seen even in pro systems
* Includes trend-weighted rebalancing to address drag from opposing exposure

### 🌟 Market Behavior Handling — **8 / 10**

* ROI \~17.25% in 10 days without aggressive risk-taking
* No major drawdowns and no manual overrides
* Signal gating via dynamic coefficient logic + multi-timeframe signal structure

### 📅 Differentiators from Retail Bots:

| Retail Bot            | This Strategy                             |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Direction guessing    | Structure- and signal-response based      |
| Fixed SL/TP           | Flexible exits via signal/margin criteria |
| No unlock logic       | Has active lock management                |
| Ignores account state | Margin-aware decision making              |

### ✅ Conclusion:

> It is a **resilient structured system**, capable of adapting to stress, reallocating capital, and maintaining autonomy.
> Its strength lies not in prediction — but in its **discipline, responsiveness, and balance control**. It is approaching fund-grade structural complexity.

## 🌐 Summary

> This system is **not based on hope, news, or discretionary clicks.**
> It is a **structured quantitative process** that: reacts, rebalances, and survives.
> All profitability is emergent from correct handling of volatility, stress, and trend.
